                    Sebastian Vettel (born 3 July 1987) is a German
                    racing driver who competed in Formula One from 2007 to 2022 for BMW Sauber, Toro Rosso, Red Bull,
                    Ferrari and Aston Martin. Vettel is one of the most successful drivers in Formula One history and
                    has won four World Drivers' Championship titles, which he won consecutively from 2010 to 2013 with
                    Red Bull. Vettel holds the record for being the youngest World Champion in Formula One, has the
                    fourth-most race third-most podium , and fourth-most pole positions
                    Vettel started his Formula One career as a test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006, making a one-off
                    racing appearance in 2007. As part of the Red Bull Junior Team, Vettel appeared for Toro Rosso later
                    that year and was kept as a full-time driver for 2008, where he scored a victory in the Italian
                    Grand Prix to become the then-youngest race winner. Vettel was promoted to Red Bull in 2009. With
                    Red Bull, Vettel won four consecutive titles from 2010 to 2013, the first of which made him the
                    sport's youngest World Champion. In 2013, he set the then-record for the most consecutive race wins
                    with Vettel signed for Ferrari for 2015 replacing Fernando Alonso and became Mercedes' and
                    Lewis Hamilton's closest challenger in two title fights in 2017 and 2018, although he finished both
                    years as runner-up. He parted ways with Ferrari at the end of the 2020 season to race with Aston
                    Martin for the 2021 and 2022 seasons, before retiring from Formula One at the end of the 2022
                    season
