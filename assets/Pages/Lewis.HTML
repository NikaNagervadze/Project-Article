                    amilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid,[137] excelling across a wide
                    range of areas.[138] He has been described as having an aggressive driving style,[139] with a
                    natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car; Mark Hughes, writing for the official
                    Formula One website, described how Hamilton is "super-hard on the brakes ... but has a fantastic
                    ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so
                    that there's no wasted grip but no locked wheels either."[140][141] Paddy Lowe, previously the
                    engineering director for McLaren, described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear
                    instability that most other drivers would find intolerable.[140]

                    Hamilton has also been praised for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set-up and changing
                    track conditions; throughout his career, he has typically used less fuel than his teammates as a
                    result of his ability to carry momentum through corners despite instability in the car.[142] Pedro
                    de la Rosa, a former test driver for McLaren who worked with Hamilton and Alonso, rated the pair as
                    the best he had seen first hand, stating that they shared a strength in terms of "how much speed
                    they can run into the apex [of a corner] and still have a decent exit speed", highlighting in
                    particular their ability to maintain this speed when their rear tyres have lost grip during a longer
                    stint.[18]
                    
                    Hamilton has been praised for his consistency, especially in his time at Mercedes. From 2017 to
                    2018, he finished 33 consecutive races in point-scoring positions, a run only brought to an end as a
                    result of mechanical issues as opposed to driver error.[143][144] Ross Brawn wrote that "over the
                    course of [2018], Hamilton hardly put a foot wrong, winning not only the races he should have, but
                    also some where the opposition was stronger, and that is the true mark of a champion."[145] Ahead of
                    the 2021 season, Martin Brundle, commentating for Sky Sports, said "I think what has stood out about
                    Lewis over the years is how few mistakes he makes, how complete he is and clean ... he just never
                    makes a mistake [in] wheel-to-wheel combat [or] in qualifying ... He just doesn't fade, mentally or
                    physically."[146]
