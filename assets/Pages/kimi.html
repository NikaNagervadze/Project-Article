                    Räikkönen met Finnish model and former Miss Scandinavia 2001, Jenni Dahlman in 2002. The couple
                    married on 31 July 2004, living between Switzerland and Finland. They separated in February 2013,
                    and divorced in 2014. Räikkönen became engaged to fitness and underwear model Minna-Mari
                    "Minttu" Virtanen] On 28 January 2015, Virtanen gave birth to the couple's first child, a
                    son. On 7 August 2016, Räikkönen married Virtanen in a ceremony in Siena, Italy.[198] On 16 May
                    2017, Räikkönen became a father for the second time with the birth of his daughter.[199] Räikkönen's
                    third child, another daughter, was born in June 2023. In 2023, the family moved from
                    Switzerland to Como, Italy.

                    Räikkönen's hobbies include snowboarding and ice hockey. He has also competed in several
                    different kinds of motorsport events. In March 2007, while his Formula One rivals were in Australia
                    preparing for the season opener, Räikkönen competed in a snowmobile race in Finland under the
                    pseudonym "James Hunt", referring to the 1976 world champion whose "playboy" lifestyle has been
                    compared with Räikkönen's own. Räikkönen won the Enduro Sprint race by over 20 seconds with his
                    Lynx. Later in the year, he and two friends entered a powerboat race in the Finnish harbour
                    city of Hanko while wearing gorilla suits. Again, he raced under the name "James Hunt". They
                    then won a prize for the best-dressed crew.</p>
